# Week 6 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:

Working with both local and remote video was interesting

### Steps for completing this week:
I chose a topic that I follow everyday and tried to it justice. I started by searching
APOD for CC images and videos. I then either downloaded the images and videos or created
an iframe from YouTube to put into my site. Finally I copied NASA's descriptions and put them
on the respective pages for each picture/video.

### Trials and Triumph
The hardest challenge was getting the links to show as my background image is too distracting.

### Going Forward
Embedding videos and Google Maps with iframes is really simple and adds a lot of ease in developing
I will definitely use them as much as I can.
