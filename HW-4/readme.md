# Week 4 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:

A lot of the tags are completely new to me. I was aware of many of the more popular tags such as links, lists, and headings. However getting to know the difference between strong and em tags as well as the definition lists and others was interesting and completely new to me.

### Steps for completing this week:
I created my directions as a simple practice plan for a basketball practice. I created the plan as an ordered list and included an unordered list for some of the list items. I also included some citations, quotes, and a link to an Amazon book from John Wooden. My second page included a list of definitions using a definition list tag.


### Trials and Triumph
Trying to make sure I included all of the necessary tags and trying to come up with items to use for each tag was challenging. However getting to use these new tags and seeing how they can be used in a real world situation was nice to get a hang of.


### Wayback Machine Exploration
I chose [espn.go.com from 1999](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19990125085631/http://espn.go.com) as a retro site to compare. The images and logos on the site are very dated especially the main logo. Nowadays it is not needed to include the .com on the end of the ESPN logo it is implied. Compared with the new site it is plain and boring. It does not seem to be as dynamic as the new ESPN site and it basically looks like a bunch of basic links.

An even more retro site is the [Missoulian from 1996](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/19961222081240/missoulian.com). Very basic images and links and not very good layout with a lot of blank white space on the right side. Also there is no online interactivity, having a phone number for subscriptions instead of a form is definitely a thing of the past.


### Going Forward
Finding uses for the new tags I have learned will be very handy. Keeping my lists more organized will also help my sanity.
