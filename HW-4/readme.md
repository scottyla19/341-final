# Week 4 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:
   - HTML

      Learned some basic HTML and how to organize various tags.

   - Github Pages

      Using Github Pages to serve our index.html file. Pages is a great way to host static sites such as our homework assignmnets.

### Steps for completing this week:
  3. Created an index.html file
  4. Added the corresponding html content and tags
  5. Added my poem in multiple paragraph tags
  6. Used font color inline styles to change colors
  7. Also added some images to spice things up


### Trials and Triumphs

  I had a little problem because I am using a Linux (Ubuntu) machine and had some problems with opening up Atom. I had to reinstall Atom and the necessary packages.

### Additional Resources
For help with basic Linux bash commands I used some online resources mainly [Linux Survival](http://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) and [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/). THey helped me learn how to navigate and manage many of the necessary commands to move, create, edit, and many other file operations.

### Going Forward
I'm looking to learn more about how to utilize CSS and HTML to create more polished sites. Also I am very interested to see how well Github Pages works and see what else Pages can do.
