        <p> As the legendary <abbr title="University of California - Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr> coach John Wooden said, <q> Be quick, but don't hurry.</q> and:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=5249709">
          <p>Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are,
           while your reputation is merely what others think you are.</p>
