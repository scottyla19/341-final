          <h1>Week 9 Summary </h1>


          <h3> Homework Cycle:</h3>

          I started from scratch and tried to follow the examples provided in the content
          for this week. It took a lot of playing around and trying different combinations
          to get it to look how I wanted. I still have some spacing, margin and padding,
          issues but for the most part the layout seems to work.

          <h3> Steps for completing this week:</h3>
          1. Decide on color palette
          2. Decide on typography
          3. Design layout
          4. Code layout
          5. Test code and fix as needed (1000X)

          <h3> Trials and Triumphs </h3>
          My main trials included
          - navigation layout: I could not get the title and logo to come first and then
          the nav bar to be aligned left. Solution was to clear: left on the menu-container.
          - content layout: Getting the aside and main content to line up and have the aside
          take up the same height as the main content. Solution was to give the main content
          a margin equal to the width of the aside. Now the aside looks to take up the entire
          height.

          <h3> Color palette </h3>
          I chose my color palette using guidelines from Google's Material Design. (Material.io)[https://www.materialpalette.com/] allows you to choose a primary color
          and an accent color and provides examples of how it would look in an Android app.
          I chose two colors that complemented each other.

          <h3> Typography </h3>
          I chose a font from Google Fonts and imported it in my CSS. I chose Roboto because
          I personally like the sans fonts as they provide a clear and no nonsense feel to the
          page.

          <h3> Going Forward </h3>
          I still need to work on being able to get css to do what I want. A lot of times
          what I think will happen does nothing or completely breaks the layout. CSS is my
          biggest struggle as, to me, it is really hard to get it tow work correctly. More
          practice and knowledge will hopefully help with this.
