# Week 5 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:

I am familiar with forms and most of this week was review for me. However have not used the autofocus which is nice. Also I learned to check the homework wiki as I had not noticed the homework specifics in the TODO tags within the weekly topics.

### Steps for completing this week:
I created the form and added the specific elements.

### Trials and Triumph
Again I have fallen behind due to not paying attention to the homework wiki as well as the Moodle website.


### Going Forward
Check the wiki for homework!!!
