  <p> The Bulls were led by playoff veteran Dwayne Wade and his 22 points. While veteran Rajon Rondo held
  Boston's prolific scorer, Isiah Thomas to 20 points and also almost tallied a triple doule himself (11 points-9 rebounds-14 assists).
   Jimmy Butler added 22 points for the Bulls. The Celtics are now down 0-2 in the best of seven series after
   losing the first two games at home. The Celtics need to find some of the defensive prowess and intensity that
   they possessed during the regular season if they want to find a way to move on in the playoffs.</p>

<p> The Clippers manhandled the Jazz from the opening tip to the final buzzer. Blake Griffin led the Clippers wit 24 points
while DeAndre Jordan pitched in 18 points and 15 rebounds and Chris Paul added 21 points and 10 assists. The Jazz never
led during the game and their only bright spot was Gordon Heyward's 20 points. It's not all grim for the Jazz, as they
at least salvaged a split on the Clippers homecourt. The series is tied 1-1 going back to Utah for the next two games.</p>
