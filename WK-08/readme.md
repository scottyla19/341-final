# Week 8 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:

I started the process by first coming up with a topic for the content. Being a
big basketball fan I decided to cover the NBA playoffs.

### Steps for completing this week:
1. Decide on color palette
2. Decide on typography
3. Create content
4. Code HTML
5. Style the content
7. Test code and fix as needed (1000X)

### Trials and Triumph
The main trial was getting the :hover to display my boxscore for each game. Learning
the difference between `display: none` and `visibility:hidden` was the key. As display:none
completely removes the object while visibility:hidden only hides the object but keeps the
space it would take up.

### Color palette
I chose my color palette using guidelines from Google's Material Design. I chose blue and red from (Materialpallette.com)[https://www.materialpalette.com/blue/red]. The blue, red, and white color
scheme corresponds with the NBA color scheme.

### Typography
I chose two fonts from Google Fonts and imported them into my CSS. I chose a serif font named Roboto Slab for the
headline h1 tag and the complementary Roboto for the rest of the body.


### Going Forward
Thinking of design in the realms of color and typography are interesting and seems like
it could be an entire class on its own. The pseudo classes and elements are also really
helpful.
