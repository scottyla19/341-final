# Week 10 Summary
### by Scott LaForest

### Homework Cycle:

I started from scratch created a responsive website with the main goal of persuading
designers and developers to use RWD in their sites.

### Steps for completing this week:
1. Decide on color palette
2. Decide on typography
3. Sketch layout
4. Create copy
5. Find images and videos to promote RWD
6. Code layout
7. Test code and fix as needed (1000X)

### Trials and Triumph
The main trial was getting used to using flexbox but once I got it down it is amazing.
I will never not use flexbox when designing layouts again. Finally CSS makes a little
more sense.

### Color palette
I chose my color palette using guidelines from Google's Material Design. I chose blue gray and deep purple from (Material.io)[https://www.materialpalette.com/blue-grey/deep-purple]

### Typography
I chose a font from Google Fonts and imported it in my CSS. I chose Open Sans because
I personally like the sans fonts as they provide a clear and no nonsense feel to the
page.

### Goals with this page
My main goal was to promote and persuade the use of RWD. The primary content is in the main-container
div and includes the video and infographic. The secondary content are my own text definitions. I
believe the first content users should see is my text. After understanding what I believe the
benefits are of RWD I provide other examples and resources for more learning.

### Going Forward
Flexbox really makes it easier. I can finally center a div both vertically and horizontall
within another. I will be using flexbox from now on as much as possible.
